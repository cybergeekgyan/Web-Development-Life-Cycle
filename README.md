# The 7 Phases of Web Development Life Cycle

## What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of building websites and web applications that work on the internet. From creating a simple static one-page website to coding a full-blown robust web application and a content management system.  

- Website development includes :-

   - the coding of the application logic
   - incorporating databases and managing user queries
   - designing user interfaces,
   - hosting the website on servers
   - maintaining and updating
   
*Each activity involved in the web development process can be classified into **server-side, client-side**, and **full-stack development**.*

## Layers of Web Development


### Server Side

Backend or server-side development incorporates all the processes that go behind the scene in a website. The management of *databases, servers, and logical components* are the main components of the backend.

These are not tangible for the users, but without a strong backend development team, your website will be an empty page that can not do any tasks. 

### Client-Side

This layer, also referred to as the frontend, mainly deals with the *visual presentation and designing of the site*. Frontend developers work on creating a seamless user experience through responsive web pages using **CSS, HTML, and JavaScript**. Without a good user interface, your website will not be able to attract customers. 

### Full Stack

Full-Stack development combines the *frontend* and *backend*, encapsulating the whole web development process. In this layer, you deal with the entire stack of tasks and technologies involved in the website development life cycle.

- This means a **full-stack engineer** is adept at *UI-UX designing, database manipulation, server hosting, and coding the browsers*. 

- These three layers together encompass the web development life cycle. It remains the same for both website and web application development.

- If you or your team is working on a development project, it is important to understand **what a web development life cycle is**. 


## What is the Web Development Cycle?

A web development life cycle concerns all the stages that go into building the website from formulating the idea to coding and designing to deploying and maintaining. It is the standard or methodical step to follow to achieve a well-functioning website.

- It gives a basic outline for developers or project managers to follow to ensure minimum errors and optimal results.  The common stages of the cycle are â€“

    - Research
    - Planning
    - Designing
    - Content creation
    - Development
    - Testing
